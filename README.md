# SDEV-140-Final-Project
GitHub Repository for SDEV 140 Final Project GUI Application

**The name of the GUI application.**
D&D 5e Character Sheet Builder

**What is the purpose of the Application?**
The purpose of this application is to provide a native medium to create new D&D character sheets in and generate an editable pdf or txt file for future customization.
List the reason you are creating the Application.
I am creating this application as an alternative means of creating new character applications, as opposed to the standard method of printing out an empty template and filling either by hand or in an image editor – both of which are more tedious.

**What do you want the Application to accomplish? List the goals you have for the Application.**
•	Allow the user to generate a new character sheet template to fill, with functionality to save as a txt file, edit an existing file, and potentially export as a finalized pdf.
•	Allow the user to generate character stats based on their preferred game parameters (point buy, standard array, random rolling, etc.)
•	Allow the user to import image files as relevant (ex: character profile pictures, organization symbols, etc.)
•	Configure the application to have compatible functionality with Dungeon Master’s Vault, an online browser-based D&D character generator. (Potential Goal – Feasibility TBD)

**Who is your target audience? Describe your target audience by age, gender, socioeconomic characteristics, and so on.**
My target audience are individuals who frequently play tabletop games such as Dungeons & Dragons and find themselves making multiple characters and character sheets when either designing or participating in a campaign. These individuals are present across a wide range of demographics but are commonly between the ages of 16 – 35 years old. The game itself is rated for ages 13+, however this application is not necessarily useful to younger/novice players unfamiliar with the character creation process.
